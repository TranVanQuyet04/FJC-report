During my internship, I participated in two events. Each one was a memorable experience that provided new, interesting, and useful knowledge, along with gifts and wonderful moments.

### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)  
&emsp;**Event name:** GenAI and Data (Gen AI and Data Track – AWS Summit)  
&emsp;**Date & time:** 09:00 – 17:30, September 18, 2025  
&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  
&emsp;**Your role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Brief description:** A full-day track focused on AWS Generative AI and data strategy. The sessions covered building a unified data platform for analytics and AI (data ingestion, cost-optimized storage, processing with services such as AWS Glue/EMR/Redshift, and governance), AWS’s GenAI roadmap (Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q), the concept of an AI-driven software development lifecycle (AI-DLC), security best practices for GenAI applications, and the growing role of AI Agents in improving organizational productivity.  
&emsp;**Outcomes / value gained:**  
&emsp;• Strengthened understanding of GenAI adoption strategy on AWS (start small, iterate, align with business goals).  
&emsp;• Learned key components of a unified data platform and why governance/access control is as important as storage and processing.  
&emsp;• Gained practical ideas for applying AI-DLC to improve productivity (documentation, test generation, code suggestions).  
&emsp;• Reinforced awareness of multi-layered GenAI security (infrastructure, model access controls, application-level protections).

### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)  
&emsp;**Event name:** GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization workshop  
&emsp;**Date & time:** 09:00, August 13, 2025  
&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Saigon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  
&emsp;**Your role:** Attendee  
&emsp;**Brief description:** A workshop on modernizing applications and databases with a focus on moving from legacy architectures to modern patterns such as microservices and event-driven architecture. The event introduced Domain-Driven Design (DDD) techniques (including event storming, bounded contexts, and context mapping), compared integration patterns (pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming), and discussed how compute models evolve from EC2 to containers and serverless. It also presented AI tooling (Amazon Q Developer and transformation agents) to support and accelerate the software development lifecycle and modernization efforts.  
&emsp;**Outcomes / value gained:**  
&emsp;• Improved ability to reason about modernization using a business-first mindset and shared “ubiquitous language.”  
&emsp;• Learned how to define service boundaries using bounded contexts and apply event-driven communication to reduce coupling.  
&emsp;• Understood decision criteria for choosing VMs vs containers vs serverless (functions vs containers).  
&emsp;• Identified actionable ways to apply the workshop concepts: run event-storming sessions, refactor services around bounded contexts, pilot async messaging, and experiment with Amazon Q Developer to boost development productivity.
