During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **08/09** to **24/12**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I gained at school in a real working environment.  
I participated in the **Metro project**, through which I improved skills such as **programming**, **requirements analysis**, **reading and understanding documentation**, **report writing**, and **communication in a professional environment**.

In terms of work ethic, I always tried to complete tasks well, complied with company regulations, and actively communicated with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
