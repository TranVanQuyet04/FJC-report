This worklog summarizes my internship learning journey over **12 weeks** in the AWS First Cloud Journey program. Each week includes the objectives, tasks performed, learning resources, and outcomes. I followed the workshops in order, completed hands-on labs (with both Console and AWS CLI where applicable), recorded key notes and screenshots as evidence, and ensured proper **resource cleanup** after each lab to avoid unexpected charges.

Across the 12 weeks, I covered: AWS fundamentals and core services, EC2 and networking basics, database deployment with RDS, high availability and scaling with ALB/ASG, cost governance (Budgets), monitoring and observability (CloudWatch), AWS Support workflows, hybrid DNS with Route 53 Resolver, AWS CLI operations, and identity & multi-account management with IAM Identity Center and Organizations.
